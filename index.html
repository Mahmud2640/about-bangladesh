          <p>
            Bangladesh: বাংলাদেশ, officially the People's Republic of
            Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most
            populous country in the world, with a population exceeding 163
            million people in an area of either 148,460 square kilometres
            (57,320 sq mi) or 147,570 square kilometres (56,980 sq mi), making
            it one of the most densely populated countries in the world.
            Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the west, north, and
            east, and Myanmar to the southeast; to the south it has a coastline
            along the Bay of Bengal. It is narrowly separated from Bhutan and
            Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor; and from China by 100 km of the
            Indian state of Sikkim in the north. Dhaka, the capital and largest
            city, is the nation's economic, political, and cultural hub.
            Chittagong, the largest seaport, is the second-largest city. The
            official language is Bengali, one of the easternmost branches of the
            Indo-European language family. Bangladesh forms the sovereign part
            of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was
            divided during the Partition of India in 1947. The country has a
            Bengali Muslim majority. Ancient Bengal was an important cultural
            centre in the Indian subcontinent as the home of the states of
            Vanga, Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata, and Harikela.
